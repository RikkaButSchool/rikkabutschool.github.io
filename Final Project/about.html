<h1>About Me</h1>

<article> I grew up in ohio. When I was younger I was always fascinated about electronics and computers. I had an xbox 360 that I would play games on and I always
     wanted to get a computer and one day when I was around 15 I got a computer for christmas. Ever since then I would watch videos about computers and people tinkering with them
      and how they work. Getting a computer sparked my interest in computers and other electronics. It was fascinating to me how they would work and how they were developed.</article>
	<p> In high school I took an information technology career class through saintclair because of my fascination with computers. I enjoyed learning about the different parts that 
        built a computer and how they functioned. I learned how to do html and css to create websites and design them. I learned some javascript and how it could be used to create
         games and apps.</p>
	<p> Some of my hobbies I enjoy doing are playing video games. I played many different games growing up such as minecraft or whatever the newest cod was.
     I enjoy watching anime as it was something I would watch to pass the time like naruto or bleach.
      I spend time with friends whether it be gaming or going somewhere like the movies. I like to watch horror movies, my favorite character would be ghostface.</p>
